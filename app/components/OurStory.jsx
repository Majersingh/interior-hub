                It began at home, like all great things... I was redecorating my
                own home, and other related projects, when people started
                approaching me to design their properties as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                I took the plunge as a hobby, and before I knew it, it turned into
                a life-long, fulfilling profession for me.
